# Image_Caption_Detection
**Image Caption Detection using CLIP** is a Streamlit-based web application that uses OpenAI's CLIP model to intelligently match uploaded images with the most relevant captions from a curated list. Users can upload one or more images, view the top matching captions ranked by similarity, and download the results in CSV format.
